Brief
Create an application using React that makes a request to an API and displays the data ensuring it shows  a clear separation of concerns (multiple components) and takes input from the user to update the page. 

The application uses 4 subreddits from Reddit as APIâ€™s, allowing the user to switch between them, view the top posts and then click through to view the content.

`npm start` runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
